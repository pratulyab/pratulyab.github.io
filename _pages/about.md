Hi, I'm Pratulya, an MS Computer Science student at <a href="https://usc.edu" target="_blank">USC</a>. <br>

Owing to my interests in deep learning, I recently interned at [Mercedes-Benz R&D India](https://mbrdi.co.in){:target="\_blank"}, where I primarily worked researching in deep learning for 3D point clouds,  graph neural networks and synthetic data generation.

Previously, I was a research assistant at [USC ISI (CKD)](http://usc-isi-i2.github.io/home/){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked on 2D image segmentation, clustering analysis and knowledge graphs.

In general, I have been into software for over 7 years now and have utilized varied technologies to solve [`real-world problems`](/projects) on different levels. Apart from AI/ML, I like to keep CS fundamentals in check and even wrote a Unix-like [`operating system`](/projects) in C.
