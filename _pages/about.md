Hi, I'm Pratulya, an MS Computer Science student at <a href="https://usc.edu" target="_blank">USC</a>. <br>

Owing to my interests in deep learning, I recently interned at [Mercedes-Benz R&D India](https://mbrdi.co.in){:target="\_blank"}, where I primarily worked researching in deep learning for 3D point clouds _(part segmentation, surface normal estimation, mesh reconstruction)_,  graph neural networks and synthetic data generation.

Previously, I was a graduate research assistant at the [Center on Knowledge Graphs](http://usc-isi-i2.github.io/home/){:target="\_blank"} at [USC ISI](https://isi.edu){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked with ML and GIS tools to segment {railroad, road, water} lines in historical topological maps and denoise the masks using cluster analysis as a post-processing step.

I'm actively seeking `SWE,MLE` full-time opportunities (US) starting Jan '22.
